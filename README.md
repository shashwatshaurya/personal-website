# Personal Website ✨

> *"This is an n\*100th attempt at making my personal website. Please wish me luck. Will try to regularly update."*

## The Journey 🚀

Welcome to yet another attempt at creating my personal website! If you've stumbled upon this repo, you're witnessing what might be the most persistent project in my GitHub history. Each iteration teaches me something new, and this time feels different—I can sense it.

This isn't just another portfolio site. It's a labor of love, built with intention and designed to grow with me. Whether you're a fellow developer, potential collaborator, or just curious about my work, I hope you find something interesting here.

## What You'll Find 🌟

- **About Me**: The story behind the code
- **Projects**: Things I've built and lessons I've learned
- **Resume**: My professional journey (with data-driven highlights!)
- **Blog**: Technical insights and thoughts (coming soon!)
- **Modern UX**: Built with performance and accessibility in mind

## Tech Stack 🛠️

This website is crafted with:

- **React 18** - For that smooth, interactive experience
- **Webpack 5** - Custom build configuration for optimal performance
- **Sass** - Because styling should be enjoyable
- **Babel** - Modern JavaScript, everywhere
- **React Router** - Seamless navigation
- **Blurhash** - Progressive image loading for better UX
- **GitHub Pages** - Simple, reliable hosting

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shashwatshaurya/personal-website.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd personal-website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:9500` in development mode.

## Development Workflow 💻

I follow a structured approach to keep things clean:

1. **Branch**: Cut a feature branch from `master`
2. **Develop**: Build and test locally
3. **Review**: Raise a PR with clear description
4. **Deploy**: Merge to master and deploy

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run deploy     # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Deployment 🚀

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from the `master` branch. The deployment process:

1. Runs the build process (`npm run build`)
2. Generates optimized static files
3. Publishes to `gh-pages` branch
4. Goes live at [shashwatshaurya.github.io/personal-website](https://shashwatshaurya.github.io/personal-website)

## A Personal Note 💭

Every failed attempt taught me something valuable. This version represents not just technical growth, but a better understanding of what I want to share with the world. It's built with modern practices, performance in mind, and most importantly—it's sustainable.

I've learned that perfect is the enemy of done, so I'm shipping iteratively and improving continuously. Each commit brings this closer to the vision I have in mind.
